  "summary": "The diff implements a three-dot vertical ellipsis menu (⋮) on the left side of the app header in AppLayout.tsx with 'Share Website' and 'Copy Link' options. All acceptance criteria for REQ-1 appear to be satisfied: the ⋮ button is placed on the left side of the header, clicking it opens a DropdownMenu, 'Share Website' uses navigator.share with title/description/URL and falls back to clipboard copy, 'Copy Link' copies the URL and shows a toast notification, and the DropdownMenu closes after selection or outside click (standard behavior of the component). No missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
